This repository contains files coded in Java by YouNeedHelp that help you calculate your grades in school or anything else. There is lots of stuff I may be uploading including a GPA calculator using the 4.0 GPA scale, a general average calculator, and maybe some other scale GPA calculator.

If you want your parents to know your GPA or average, let them know that this tool is free and available for them!
